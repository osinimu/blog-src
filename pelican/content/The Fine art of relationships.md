In the last 10,000 years there has been an explosion of the human population from 7 million to 7 billion,  during this period the slow deliberate forces of evolution has shaped our emotions. An emotion in essence is the impulse to act. Our mental life consists of two minds--  The thinking mind and the feeling mind.   

 Academic Intelligence inability to predict unerringly who will succeed in life has become an open secret. At its peak IQ, contributes about 20% to the factors that determine success,  which leaves about 80% to other forces. Academic intelligence offers virtually no preparation for the dearth- or opportunity that life's oscillations bring. Of course there are many paths to success in life, In our ever increasing knowledge-based society technical skills is definitely one,  but even among these needs, Emotional Intelligence offers an edge in the rigours of life. 

It has been recognised that the human army of abilities goes far beyond the narrow beat of word and number skills that schools traditionally focus on.  These brain skills which are tested for by taking tests,  exams- which are based on a limited comprehension of intelligence,  one that does not in any way portray the range of skills and abilities, that matter for life over and beyond IQ. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand our own emotions and those of other people and to act in a useful way based on that understanding. Lack of emotion causes lack of progress and lack of motivation.

In relationships what escalates to conflict begins with '' not communicating, making assumptions and jumping into conclusions ''  thereby making it hard for people to hear what you are saying.  The point of emotional intelligence as regards relationships is not to avoid conflict completely but to resolve disagreement and resentment before it spirals into an out and out fight. You need to assert your views without resorting to blaming,  name calling and yelling. We need to come to a point of illumination of ourselves and relationships with others seeing things from another's perspective,  which breaks down biased stereotypes,  thereby breeding tolerance and acceptance of differences. All these can only be achieved by our level of emotional intelligence.

 By better understanding and managing our emotions, we are better able to communicate our feelings in a more constructive way. We are also better able to understand and relate to those that we have formed a relationship with. Understanding the needs, feelings, and responses of those we care about leads to stronger and more fulfilling relationships.
